#### /sip-token

### Header

|      Key       |            Value            |
| :------------: |     :-----------------:     |
|  Client-Token  | **[ACCOUNT SECURITY TOKEN](../security/client-token)** |

---

## Concept

This method is used to generate SIP credentials for the instance.

These credentials allow integration with telephony services via the SIP protocol, enabling making and receiving calls.  
If an active SIP token already exists, this method may generate a new one or reuse the existing token, depending on the configuration.

---

:::caution Attention

To use this feature, the call functionality must be **enabled and contracted** for your account.  
Otherwise, the request may be denied.  
This endpoint should be used in the **backend** to avoid exposing sensitive credentials.
