## Concept

Method used to create an instance linked to your account.

:::tip Tip

You don't necessarily need to subscribe to the instance at this point as you have 2 days to use it as a trial.

:::

:::caution Attention 

**Deleting an instance**

If you do not subscribe within 2 days, our devops will automatically delete the machine connected to the instance. So in cases of no signatures you don't have to worry :)
